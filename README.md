# Laptop Price Predictor

## Overview
This project aims to predict laptop prices based on various features such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, and screen size. The goal is to create an accurate machine learning model that helps users estimate the price of a laptop given its specifications.

## Features
- **Brand**: The brand of the laptop (e.g., Dell, HP, Lenovo).
- **Processor**: The type and speed of the processor (e.g., Intel Core i5, AMD Ryzen 7).
- **RAM**: The amount of RAM memory in gigabytes (GB).
- **Storage**: The type and size of storage (e.g., SSD, HDD, 256GB, 1TB).
- **Screen Size**: The diagonal size of the laptop screen in inches.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
The data for this project was gathered from various sources containing laptop specifications and prices. The data underwent preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

## Model Training
We used regression techniques to train the machine learning model. Regression models are suitable for predicting continuous target variables, making them ideal for predicting laptop prices. The model was trained on the preprocessed data to accurately predict laptop prices based on the provided features.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebook)

## Results
The trained model achieves 85 percent. Users can input laptop specifications and receive an estimated price as output.

## Future Improvements
- Explore advanced machine learning techniques such as ensemble methods and neural networks for potentially higher accuracy.
